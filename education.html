                Worked with a team of four to plan, design, build, and test a raised bed and vertical garden for plantation and a water catchment system to recycle the rain to increase self-sustainability
                Gained manufacturing and system engineering skills such as machining and project management
                Presented the design and project to Growing Hope to promote healthy eating and self-sustainable gardens to inner city households with low income

                Accent Hallucination: 
            </p>
            <p class="p_general">
                Implicit bias is defined as referring to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. 
                The focus of my project was on the implicit bias of race and how it affects people audio and interpretation. 
                To be quite precise, I basically replicated Donald Rubin’s studies of 
                NONLANGUAGE FACTORS AFFECTING UNDERGRADUATES' JUDGMENTS OF NONNATIVE ENGLISH-SPEAKING TEACHING ASSISTANTS. 
                Thus, the basis of my project was the Rubin’s experiment, 
                and I have also taken a little bit of basic concept and idea from McGowan’s Social Expectation Improves Speech Perception in Noise.
